                    <p class="txt-left">Nice to meet you! My name is Donny Dianderas, and I have embarked on the fantastic journey of programming at the age of 38. 
                    My main motivation is my two children and the support of my beloved wife. I am an Industrial Engineer with 15 years of experience in various manufacturing companies. 
                    I began my technical career after studying at TECSUP Institute, located in Lima, Peru. Previously, I served as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Chile Viña del Mar Mission. 
                    I believe that consistency opens many doors, and I think that more important than starting with a goal is learning from mistakes and finishing the cycles we start; in other words, enduring to the end applies to everything in life.</p>

                    <p class="txt-right">Lima, the capital of Peru, is a mix of history, culture, and modern life. You can visit the Historic Center for its old buildings, 
                    Miraflores for ocean views, and Barranco for art and nightlife. It's famous for its delicious food, like ceviche, and top restaurants. You can also see museums, enjoy beaches, or visit ancient ruins like Pachacamac. 
                    Lima is a great place with something for everyone!</p>
